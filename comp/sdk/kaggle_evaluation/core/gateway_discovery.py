"""Auto-discovery of the competition gateway class.

When a submission runs on Kaggle, the competition-specific gateway ships as a
``*gateway.py`` file inside a ``kaggle_evaluation/`` directory under
``/kaggle/input``. This module locates that file, imports it, and returns the
gateway class so callers don't have to hard-code the class name.

Discovery uses ``ast`` to find class definitions that inherit from a
``*Gateway`` base such as :class:`Gateway`, :class:`GameGateway`, or
:class:`BaseGateway`.
